However, this not a haven, but a harrowing hall of hellish horrors. At the end of the journey ahead of you sits a serpant few dare to name for fear of her wrath, but you refuse to rest until she too meets the final fate she once imposed upon your loved ones. However, the journey ahead is long, and you have only just begun. Be spry, for the sphinx saunters ahead and is not satisfied by simple supposition.",

  "The dour dunes before you demonstrate the deceptive nature of this desolate garden. You understand the ultimate decision determining your departure lies in the umbra, unknown.",

Your people hold a feast in your honor, as you have proven yourself worthy of the title hero. You are satisfied: for at the end of it all, there is cake.",
